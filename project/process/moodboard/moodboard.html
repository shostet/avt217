<p>The first moodboard is strong and bold while the second feels softer, more abstract, and more colorful. While I'm leaning towards the design of the second, I also want to make sure that the site is descriptive enough to convey each part of my portfolio. The color schemes are subject to change as I was playing around with them and the readability of text may not work as much in practice.</p>
