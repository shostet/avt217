	<h1>Revised Mockup Idea #2</h1>
	<p>This is the revised version of my second mockup idea. I'm fairly happy with how this turned out, though I will likely be messing with and replacing fonts for the final revision.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Home Page</h2>
	<p>I personally think that the home page turned out super nice for this version! However, I was unfortunately unable to get the music video assets done on time (will be working on those this week) so I used the youtube logo as a filler for now (I changed the color from red to purple since the red was very obnoxious and drew too much attention to itself).</p>

	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>While I'm not sure if I want to keep the 3 picture design or figure out a different way to lay out the images, I'm fairl happy with how the about me page turned out. Looking at it now, I think I could also mess around with the background of the "contact me" box to make the color less jarring and bright compared to the page background.</p>

	<h2>Portfolio Page</h2>
	<p>The portfolio page now has images as well! The dog gifs (bottom right) will animate in the eventual web version. I'm not sure I'm crazy about the layout of the images as it feels a bit simplistic, but I can clean it up in the final revision. My idea for the portfolio navigation at the bottom, same as the first mockup idea, would be that each piece has its own page and category. The back and next pages will take you between pieces of each category, and the three category buttons would take you between the different categories, starting you on the first piece of the category. Hope this makes sense! I might workshop the layout of this for the final revision.</p>
