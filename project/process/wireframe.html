<p><strong>Wireframe idea #1</strong> would have two main links from the home page: about me and portfolio. From there, about me would contain info, my resume, and a contact me section (all on the same page). Portfolio would have links to three different pages: music, games, and other works for the three categories of work. Each page would also have a site banner (title of page, icon, and site banner) as well as a footer with navigation (home, about me, portfolio).</p>
	
<p><strong>Wireframe idea #2</strong> would have links to everything on the home page. At the top, a small blurb about me would link to a longer info page with resume and contact info. Underneath, there would be images that link to indivudal pages for each work (categorized). Each portfolio page would have pictures as well information about the project and my work process.</p>
